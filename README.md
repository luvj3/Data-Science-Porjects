This project demonstrates how to predict student scores based on study hours using a simple linear regression model implemented in Python. To set up, clone the repository, optionally create a virtual environment, and install the required packages (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) via pip install -r requirements.txt. The main script (student_score_prediction.py) trains the model on a dataset of study hours and scores, evaluates its performance using MAE, MSE, and R-squared metrics, and visualizes the results with a scatter plot and regression line. It also includes a function to predict scores based on inputted study hours. To run the project, simply execute the script with Python, and it will train the model, evaluate it, and provide predictions along with visual insights.

# Student Score Prediction Based on Study Hours

This project demonstrates the use of a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on the number of hours they spend studying. The goal is to understand the relationship between study hours and student performance, and to make predictions about student scores given a specific number of study hours.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the percentage score of students based on the number of study hours.
- **Methodology**: Implement a linear regression model to understand the relationship between study hours and scores.
- **Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

Install Required Packages
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the necessary Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you donâ€™t have a requirements.txt file, create one with the following content:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib

Run the Project
You can run the project script using the following command:
python student_score_prediction.py
